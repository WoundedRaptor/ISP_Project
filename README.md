Fantasy Football Draft Strategy Analysis
Project Overview
This project aims to determine the optimal rookie draft strategy in annual fantasy football rookie drafts by analyzing NFL rookie datasets. The analysis covers up to nine years of NFL experience, average draft positions in fantasy football rookie drafts, and college/university draft capital.

Objectives
Analyze NFL rookie datasets to identify patterns and trends.
Determine the impact of college performance on professional fantasy football performance.
Develop a scoring system to evaluate player performance across different positions.
Provide actionable insights for drafting strategies in fantasy football.
Scoring System

Key Findings
Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers:

Fantasy points are distributed across various draft positions, suggesting draft rank is not a strong predictor of performance.
Running Backs:

There is a clear correlation between higher draft ranks and better fantasy performance, indicating the importance of drafting running backs early.
Tight Ends:

Performance is widely distributed, making draft rank a poor predictor.
Optimal Draft Strategy
First Round:

Target Running Backs from top schools (Alabama, Georgia, Wisconsin).
Second Round:

Target Wide Receivers from top schools (Alabama, Ohio State, Oklahoma).
Third to Fifth Rounds:

Avoid Tight Ends due to unpredictability.
Consider Quarterbacks from top schools (Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas Tech) if needed.
Methodology

Data Cleaning:
Addressed inconsistencies in player names to match draft positions with statistics accurately.

Data Analysis:
Conducted regression analysis and correlation testing to identify key trends and insights.

Analysis:
Focused on cleaning and analyzing data to develop a strong foundational understanding of data processing techniques.

Ruture Work:
Apply High-Performance Computing (HPC) to analyze larger datasets and leverage machine learning for deeper insights.
Expand the analysis to include more comprehensive datasets for robust conclusions.

Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of fantasy football draft strategies, emphasizing the importance of leveraging college performance data and focusing on high-performing schools. By understanding the correlations and distributions of fantasy points across draft positions, fantasy football managers can make more informed decisions to enhance their draft outcomes.
